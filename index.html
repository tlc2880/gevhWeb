            <p>Mary Ann D</p>
            <p>Our family thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this home. Spacious and comfortable for our family of 8 adults and 4 kids. 
              The house was fully stocked with household items. The kids loved the game/rec room. We didn't get a chance to make use 
              of the pool cause we were so busy but it's definitely a good bonus feature of the house. Great/convenient location. 
              Close to stores, restaurants, the Outlets and of course, Disneyland. If I had to complain about something, 
              the sheets/bedding didn't look washed in the Master bedroom (white drool marks), wood floors creaked and water in the 
              shower was inconsistent. But these were minor and livable. We would not hesitate to stay here again.</p>

            <p class="response">Hello Mary Ann, Thank you for staying at my vacation home. We have put new bed sheets in the Master bedroom. 
              When there are 3 people showering at the same time, the water heater may have trouble keeping up with the demand. 
              We have set the water heater on the hottest setting so we will have continuous warm water flowing. Tommy</p>

            <p>The house worked very well for us. We had four families including seven young children and stayed five days/four nights.
              We made one trip to Costco and were able to cook and BBQ on the grill to minimize eating out every day. 
              The house was well stocked with any and everything we needed from toys/games for the kids on down to spices in the cabinet for cooking. 
              Although we didn't travel with any children under two, it was nice to see the house also had high chairs, playpens, and strollers etc. 
              The house was clean, well maintained, and in a great centralized location. This house definitely made our stay feel like being at home. 
              We look forward to booking future stays!</p>

            <p>We were very happy with the room set up. Each couple had their own room, and the cousins enjoyed sharing a room. Everyone enjoyed the pool & spa. 
              Previous renters left some basics like salt, pepper, sugar, and coffee filters. We were close to Disneyland and the easy 
              access to I-5 made our trips to San Diego convenient. Great stay!</p>

            <p>Tommys house was very nice and clean. Great size for our large group. The only reason we didn't give a 5 star rating was 
              due to a neighbors dog that barked ALL NIGHT LONG. We realize this is not Tommys fault but if it wasn't for that it would 
              have been the perfect stay. Thank you Tommy.</p>

              <p>Family Vacation Thank you Tommy we had a great time. Your house is beautiful, plenty of room and great location. 
                The pool and hot tub were awesome after a day at Disney (sorry about the chlorine dispenser keep being removed, kids!).  
                They have everything you need, we appreciated the extra stroller, and the crockpot was great to put dinner in 
                before we left for the day, come back to dinner done, then go back to Disney for night entertainment. 
                It was close to everything, shopping, entertainment, beach... We would definitely consider this house in the future.</p>

              comfortably with room for more. We enjoyed the pool and backyard. The owner was helpful and attentive

              <p>PRISCILLA J</p>
              <p>I wish I hadn't read the one bad review from November because we brought unnecessary items. First of all the 
                things they complained about were petty, in my opinion! There were plenty of towels and they were good quality, 
                there were plenty of dishware (so what if they didn't match), the bathrooms were decorated appropriately, 
                the bedrooms were nicely decorated as well and the extra bedding, he had extra air beds and playpens if you needed them. 
                He had spices, laundry detergents, and plenty of pots and pans for cooking. The only thing I suggest bringing is 
                extra garbage bags and toilet paper. I'm sure if we called him and asked for more he would've brought it but we 
                just went out and got more tp and I packed extra garbage bags. The kids loved the playroom and stayed in there 
                most of the vacation (which was a relief to the adults). We especially appreciated that there were televisions 
                in every room with direct tv. The house had plenty of room for 16 of us. We were never in each others way. 
                The only reason I gave the house a 4 was because the tarp for the pool was damaged and I wish I hadn't paid 
                extra to heat the pool. It was too cold to use, even mildly heated. However, the jacuzzi was a wonderful treat 
                to come home to after a long day at Disneyland!! The Christmas tree was also a nice touch! We would definitely 
                come again to this rental!!</p>

              Easy access to the freeway! Wish we had more time to enjoy the pool! We had problems with the heating,
